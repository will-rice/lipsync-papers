# lipsync-papers

A curated, automatically-updated collection of papers on **lip sync**, talking-head synthesis, audio-driven face animation, and related topics — starting from [Wav2Lip](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10010) (2020) and growing every week.

Beyond a reading list, this repo is built to be **browsed by LLMs**. Every paper is mirrored as a markdown file with structured YAML frontmatter and inline citation links that resolve to sibling files in the corpus when the cited work is here, or to arXiv / DOI otherwise. Point an agent at [`papers/README.md`](papers/README.md) and it can crawl the literature graph the same way you would.

## How it works

- Papers are sourced from [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) and [Hugging Face Papers](https://huggingface.co/papers) via their public APIs. (Entries with `s2:` IDs are historical finds from Semantic Scholar, which was retired as a source after persistent API rate-limiting.)
- Query this corpus over MCP: `https://wrice-papers-mcp.hf.space/lipsync/mcp` ([server code](https://huggingface.co/spaces/wrice/papers-mcp)).
- A [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/fetch_papers.yml) runs **daily at 06:00 UTC** to pull papers submitted in the previous 8 days.
- Results are filtered with a negative-keyword blacklist plus an ML signal check and a positive lipsync/talking-face relevance gate.
- The full paper list is stored in [`papers.csv`](papers.csv) and the table below is regenerated automatically on every update.

## Markdown corpus

Each paper is also available as LLM-friendly markdown under `papers/<year>/<arxiv_id>.md`. The conversion pipeline:

- Converts arXiv's HTML rendering (`arxiv.org/html/<id>`, falling back to [ar5iv](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org) for pre-2024 papers) — the article is extracted from the page, figures become absolute-URL images, and equations become GitHub-native ` ```math ` blocks.
- Papers without a usable HTML rendering fall back to LaTeX source (`arxiv.org/e-print/<id>`) via [pandoc](https://pandoc.org), then PDF via [marker](https://github.com/datalab-to/marker).
- Auto-flagged or manually-listed (`papers/.fixme.txt`) low-quality outputs go through a Claude Sonnet 4.6 remediation pass.
- Citations are rewritten as clickable links — local sibling MD when the cited paper is in this corpus, external arXiv/DOI URLs otherwise.

Browse the corpus at [papers/README.md](papers/README.md). Each paper file has YAML frontmatter with metadata + diagnostics (`source`, `converter`, `llm_remediated`, `citations_resolved`).

## Running locally

You'll need pandoc and Node (for Prettier, which normalizes the generated markdown):

```bash
# macOS
brew install pandoc node

# Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install pandoc nodejs npm
```

Then run `npm ci` to install the pinned Prettier used by the pipeline, CI, and pre-commit.

```bash
# Incremental fetch (last 8 days)
uv run python scripts/fetch_papers.py

# Full historical fetch (everything since 2020-01-01)
uv run python scripts/fetch_papers.py --full
uv run python scripts/convert_papers.py --regenerate-all

# Custom window
uv run python scripts/fetch_papers.py --days 30
```

The fetch script uses only the Python standard library (plus a Prettier pass on the README); the conversion pipeline adds `marker-pdf`, `anthropic`, `pyyaml`, and the `pandoc` system binary (managed via `uv` and your package manager). Both scripts format the markdown they generate with the repo-pinned [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) (`npm ci`), and a [Format workflow](.github/workflows/format.yml) enforces it on every PR.

## Triggering a manual update

Open the **Actions** tab → **Fetch Lipsync Papers** → **Run workflow**.
Select _full = true_ to back-fill from 2020 and rebuild all paper markdown, or leave it as _false_ for an incremental update.

<summary>Abstract</summary>

Preparing for job interviews is important for securing desired positions, yet realistic practice remains difficult to access: real interviews are infrequent, expert mock coaching is costly, and self-practice offers neither adaptive dialogue nor structured assessment. Existing systems typically address only parts of this need through fixed question sequences, limited communication channels, or feedback with little supporting evidence. We present PolyInterview, an LLM-based platform for immersive mock interview practice with comprehensive multimodal assessment. PolyInterview uses the target job description and CV to generate questions tailored to the role and candidate, conducts multi-turn spoken interviews with a lip-synced digital human interviewer that asks answer-aware follow-up questions, and evaluates response content, vocal delivery, and non-verbal behavior. Four parallel evaluators produce 13 behavior-level features that are aggregated into 10 assessment aspects and two competency tracks. Guided by the KSA and STAR frameworks, the report links each score to behavioral evidence and actionable recommendations. PolyInterview is publicly accessible. Its current all-account snapshot contains 101 accounts, 1,564 interview sessions, 7,665 generated questions, and 1,422 five-stage question sets. Generated questions are more closely aligned with their matched job description than with cross-role job descriptions in 93.7% of sessions. An evaluation by ten experts found strong question plans and actionable feedback.

The rapid advancement of the deepfake generation technologies has intensified concerns related to digital misinformation, identity impersonation, and media manipulation. Although numerous deepfake detection methods have been developed by mitigate these threats, most rely on a single modality and exhibit limited robustness when confronted with diverse manipulation techniques and cross-dataset scenarios. To overcome these deficiencies, we propose VeriSphere, a multimodal deepfake detection framework that combines spatial, temporal, and audiovisual forensics in one system. It uses a Vision Transformer for detecting spatial artifacts, an X-CLIP-based module for capturing temporality, and an AV synchronization module to examine whether speech aligns with lip movements. The outputs are then fused using a weighted strategy to produce a single trust score for prediction. Results show that VeriSphere achieves a high accuracy of 92.1%, an AUC of 0.963, and an F1-score of 0.924 across three benchmark datasets: FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and DFDC.

#### [SyncCache: Exploiting Asymmetric Dynamics for Fast Audio-Driven Portrait Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.30849) · [📄 Read](papers/2026/2606.30849.md)

<summary>Abstract</summary>

Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have significantly advanced audio-driven portrait animation, but their high computational cost leads to substantial inference latency. Although training-free diffusion caching accelerates inference significant, existing methods are primarily developed for text-conditioned generation and overlook the spatial and modality imbalances inherent in audio-driven portrait animation. In this paper, we propose SyncCache, a training-free caching acceleration method tailored for DiT-based portrait animation that explicitly exploits asymmetric dynamics. Specifically, high-frequency dynamics driven by audio conditions and concentrated in human regions are more challenging and critical to cache and reuse than the low-frequency visual background in portrait animation. First, we introduce Spatially-Asymmetric Probing to prioritize error sensitivity in dynamic human region. Second, through Modality-Decoupled Caching, we bypass heavy DiT block by reusing stable inter-block residuals, while continuously recomputing lightweight audio blocks to preserve precise lip synchronization. Furthermore, we introduce a cache ratio to control cache capacity and formulate memory-adaptive cache selection as an offline dynamic programming problem without online overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SyncCache achieves superior speed-quality trade-offs, delivering up to 4.12x acceleration on HunyuanVideo-Avatar and 3.75x on Wan-S2V with near-lossless visual fidelity and precise audio alignment.

<summary>Abstract</summary>

The synthesis of lifelike three-dimensional (3D) talking heads from audio requires precise lip synchronization and nuanced facial expressions. However, current methods often fall short of this goal, largely due to the scarcity of large-scale, diverse training data. To address this issue, this paper first presents a novel, semi-automated pipeline to efficiently harvest audio and corresponding 3D facial FLAME data from public videos. We then use this pipeline to construct DIVA-3D, a large-scale, diverse, in-the-wild audio-visual dataset, which contains 73 hours of both Chinese and English data. This is, to our best knowledge, the most topically diverse 3D talking head dataset available, with six distinct domains. Based on DIVA-3D, we propose a robust generative framework that produces highly accurate lip synchronization and natural facial expressions. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark of state-of-the-art methods using our new dataset. Extensive results validate the effectiveness of our dataset and demonstrate the superior performance of our framework, underscoring its significant practical value of our framework for real-world applications.

<summary>Abstract</summary>

Speech-driven 3D facial animation methods face significant challenges in simultaneously achieving high-fidelity motion and precise artistic control at production quality. Existing controllable models typically learn global style control by relying on large-scale, low-quality \emph{in-the-wild} datasets that compromise overall animation realism. Furthermore, these frameworks often lack the fine-grained temporal precision required for demanding tasks such as dialogue localization (e.g., dubbing), where matching specific facial expressions is as critical as lip synchronization. We present KM-Speaker (Keypoint-Matching Speaker), a novel keypoint-conditioned flow-based generative framework that provides both global style guidance and frame-level temporal control from reference performances. We propose a disentanglement strategy that separates audio-driven lip motion from keypoint-driven upper-face dynamics, together with a global style context preservation mechanism to ensure coherent full-face expressiveness. KM-Speaker advances example-based 3D facial animation by achieving high-fidelity motion and flexible controllability in a data-constrained setting, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods in lip-sync accuracy, style adherence, and expressive temporal control.

#### [Audio-visual Contrastive Alignment for Diffusion-based Visual-conditioned Speech Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.23712) · [📄 Read](papers/2026/2606.23712.md)

<summary>Abstract</summary>

Audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) exploits visual cues such as lip movements to recover speech in noisy environments. Recent work introduced diffusion-based unsupervised AVSE, where a speech diffusion model conditioned on visual features via cross-attention is trained and used as a data-driven prior for posterior sampling-based speech enhancement. Despite promising performance over its audio-only counterpart, the impact of explicitly enforcing cross-modal alignment in the fusion remains unclear. In this work, we propose to augment the diffusion training objective with a contrastive audio-visual loss to encourage stronger use of visual information while keeping the posterior sampling framework unchanged. Experiments across matched and mismatched test data show consistent improvements in interference suppression, signal reconstruction, and perceptual quality, with the largest gains at low SNRs.
